# CRTapp

App developed by Isabel Banks, Zach Glover, Zach Loschinskey, and Morgan Parmeley for BME4980W at the University of Missouri, Columbia.

This app is part of a website for the standardization of capillary refill time as a pediatric diagnostic test.

The goal is to create a free, accessible, and accurate CRT test method entirely accessible through the web browser.
